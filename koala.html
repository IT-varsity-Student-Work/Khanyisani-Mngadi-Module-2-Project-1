              <h3>KOALA</h3>
              <P>The koala is one of the world’s most iconic animal species – right up there with the panda, tiger, elephant, dolphin, and polar bear. And they're found nowhere else in the world but Australia!

Our much loved koalas, with their stout, tailless body, large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose, are instantly recognisable as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are an integral part of the Australian bush – perched high up in the branches of gum trees sleeping for up to 20 hours a day

 

A common mistake is calling them a ‘koala bear,’ they’re marsupials not bears. Find out more interesting facts about koalas. </P>
                
                
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <P>You will find the KOALA right next to the GIRAFFE</P>
